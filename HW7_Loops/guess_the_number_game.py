# Task: 

#   Create a Python program for a "Guess the Number" game. The game will generate a random number within a specified range and prompt the user to guess the number. 
#   The program provides feedback based on the user's guess - whether it's too high, too low, or correct. The game continues until the user guesses the number correctly.
# 
# Requirements:

    # Random Number Generation: The program should generate a random number within a given range (e.g., 1 to 10). 
    # You can use the random.randint(1, 10) method, after including in your code import random
    # User Input: Prompt the user to enter their guess. Ensure, the user guess is in the range, and if not, display "Your guess is out of bounds."
    # Feedback to User: After each guess, the program should provide feedback: 
    # If the guess is too high, display "Too hight!"
    # If the guess is too low, display "Too low!"
    # If the guess is correct, display "Congratulations! You guessed it right."
    # Repeat Guesses: The game should continue, allowing the user to guess again if the guess is incorrect.
    # Terminate the Game: Once the correct number is guessed, the game should end with message "Bravo, you guessed my number"
    # Optional - Guess Counter: Keep track of the number of guesses the user makes and display this count when the correct number is guessed.

# Bonus Challenge:
    
    # Add a feature to limit the number of guesses a user can make. If the user doesn't guess the number within the limit, end the game with a message indicating that the user has lost.
    # Implement a difficulty level for the game (e.g., easy, medium, hard), where each level has a different range of numbers or a different number of allowed guesses.
